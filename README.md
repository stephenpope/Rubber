A port of the ElasticSearch Query DSL into .NET..

This was done mainly as the other .NET ElasticSearch clients (NEST & ElasticSearch.NET) don't have a very complete DSL currently.

This one should be complete (if I've missed something please let me know) and should be usable with both NEST and ElasticSearch.NET

This is a direct port of the Java with the odd bit of .NET-ness here and there for convenience.
